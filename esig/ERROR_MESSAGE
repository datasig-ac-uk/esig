If you see this message, compilation and installation unfortunately failed. If 
building from source, the esig package requires the Boost C++ library to be 
installed and correctly configured. Installation most likely failed because the 
installer was not able to locate Boost.

Please make sure you have done the following.
	* Downloaded and installed a copy of Boost.
	  How you do this varies from platform to platorm.
	* Provided the necessary paths to Boost include files and libraries.
	  This is only necessary when installing Boost to a non-standard 
      location.
	  If you do this, you can use the --include-paths and --library-paths 
      arguments.

Once you have done this, esig should install successfully. For more 
information, you can refer to the online documentation. It's available at
